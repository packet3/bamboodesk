Bamboo Desk
============

What is Bamboo Desk?
---------------------
Bamboo Desk is a forked rebirth of [Trellis Desk](https://github.com/ACCORD5/TrellisDesk) 
Originally created by Accord5 (a company that no longer exists).

Development of Trellis Desk stopped 10 years ago. I, Joe enjoyed using the software back
then.  I decided to start off from where the original developers had finished.

my goal is to make Bamboo Desk the best self-hosted helpdesk software there is 


Status
------

Bamboo Desk 1.0 is under development,  and I can only work on it when I
have the time and is not recommended for a production
environment.  With the help of user contributions (Hint if you would like to help out I would be grateful) and the support of the
community, I  hope to have a stable, documented release by the end of 2022 or early 2023.



Requirements
------------

* PHP 7.4+
* MySQL 5.7+
* GD2 + FreeType (for some CAPTCHA support)


Installation
------------

Bamboo Desk 1.0 is in an early development stage.  We strongly recommend
against using Bamboo Desk 1.0 in a production environment.  To install, simply
upload all files to your web server, point your browser to the *install*
directory, and follow the on-screen instructions.


Why Open Source?
----------------

I can only develop Bamboo Desk in my spare time. I want Bamboo Desk to succeed and releasing the software
as open source I believe in time that the community members can help grow and make Bamboo Desk a successful project.



Plan
--------
Since Bamboo Desk is a rebirth (forked) copy of the original Trellis Desk which was orginally
created for PHP 5, There is a lot of Bug fixes, deprecated code and re-writes to be done
to bring Bamboo Desk into the modern world.

such tasks include but not limited too:
- Remove Jquery Dependency
- Remove Deprecated code 
- Improve PHP Code to work with PHP 7.4+
- Improve the UI
- Follow OOP
- Improve Database Access and Queries



Of course, head on over to the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/packet3/bamboodesk/issues) for more.


Contributing
------------

Everyone is invited to contribute their own bug fixes and feature additions.
GitHub pull requests are preferred, but if you want to attach a diff to a ticket
or link us to your branch, that's cool too.

Find a bug in Bamboo Desk (Probably Loads at this stage)? Please submit a
[new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/packet3/bamboodesk/issues/new).

Or maybe you're in the mood to hunt some bugs yourself? Hit up the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/packet3/bamboodesk/issues)!

In all honesty, many will find the Bamboo Desk 1.0 code unorganized.  Many of
the code originates from the original forked project Trellis Desk before I (Joe) decided to give it a rebirth
